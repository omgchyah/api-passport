# Laravel API with Passport, MySQL, and Docker or Composer üöÄüöÄ

This is a Laravel 11 API using PHP, MySQL, and Laravel Passport for authentication. It provides user registration, login, dice games for players, and an admin-specific player ranking system.

You can run this project either with Docker (using Laravel Sail) or without Docker using Composer and your local PHP setup.

# Requirements üîß

# Docker-Based Setup

    Docker
    Docker Compose

# Composer-Based Setup

    PHP 8.1 or higher
    Composer
    MySQL
  

# Running the Application with Composer (Without Docker) üõ†Ô∏è

    This option uses PHP, Composer, and MySQL directly on your local machine.

    # Step 1: Clone the Repository

    git clone -b develop https://github.com/omgchyah/api-passport.git
    cd api-passport

    # Step 2: Install Composer Dependencies

    Make sure Composer is installed on your system, then run:

    composer install

    # Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

    Copy the .env.example to .env and update the environment variables to match your local setup, particularly for MySQL.

    cp .env.example .env

    In the .env file, make sure the following variables are set correctly:

    env

    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
    DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password

    # Step 4: Generate Application Key

    Run the following command to generate the application key:

    php artisan key:generate

    # Step 5: Set Up the Database

    Create a MySQL database for your project. Once the database is set up, run the migrations:

    php artisan migrate

    # Step 6: Install Passport

    Run the following command to install Laravel Passport:

    php artisan passport:install

    # Step 7: Serve the Application

    You can serve the application locally using PHP's built-in server:

    php artisan serve

    Your application will now be available at http://localhost:8000.

# Running the Application with Docker #

    This option uses Docker and Laravel Sail to manage the environment.

    # Step 1: Clone the Repository

    git clone -b develop https://github.com/omgchyah/api-passport.git
    cd api-passport

    # Step 2: Set Up the Environment

    Copy the .env.example file to .env and update the environment variables as needed:

    cp .env.example .env

    # Step 3: Install Dependencies

    Run the following command to install Composer dependencies within Docker:

    ./vendor/bin/sail composer install

    # Step 4: Start Docker Containers

    Start the Docker containers with Laravel Sail:

    ./vendor/bin/sail up -d

    # Step 5: Run Migrations

    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate

    # Step 6: Install Passport

    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan passport:install

 # API Endpoints ‚öôÔ∏è
