From the terminal:

Creating an alias for "vendor/bin/sail":

- nano ~/.bashrc
- Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following line:
alias sail='[ -f sail ] && bash sail || bash vendor/bin/sail'

Save and Exit:

    If you're using nano, save and exit by pressing CTRL + X, then Y for yes, and Enter to confirm.

After saving the file, apply the changes by sourcing the file:
    
    - source ~/.bashrc

Now, you can use sail as a shortcut directly in your Visual Studio Code terminal. For example:

To create API scaffolding with passport package:

sail php artisan api:install --passport

To create and use tokens:

sail php artisan passport:client --personal

 What should we name the personal access client? [Laravel Personal Access Client]:
 > API Auth

    INFO  Personal access client created successfully.  

  Client ID ............................................ 1  
  Client secret . UzW6zGPtwuwP8aFZJDB2zXhVyBidHDRb37nH2HpG

  Add Passport guard to my config/auth.php file:

      'guards' => [
        'web' => [
            'driver' => 'session',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],
        'api' => [
            'driver' => 'passport',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],
    ],

    Modify User model:

    use Laravel\Passport\HasApiTokens;

    class User extends Authenticatable
    {
    use HasApiTokens, HasFactory, Notifiable;
